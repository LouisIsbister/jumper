# Jumper  
As much as I enjoy doing things from the command line, one thing I thoroughly dislike is typing out really long and laborious directoy paths to get to my frequently visited directories, especially my university directory! As such, this is a simple program to that allows you to hook directories you often visit and navigate to them immediately by just executing `jumper <hook_name>`. I am fully aware this is neither orignal nor very difficult to make, I just wanted an execuse to write something small in C :)
